# Zwyrafi
## Is a more in-depth:
  - optimization
  - enhancement
  - mod
 #### **of [Dying Light](https://dyinglightgame.com/dyinglight/) designed to make it more playable and enjoyable.**

## Zwyrafi is not:
 - A cheat
 - A vector for cheats

and does not intentionally provide an unfair advantage in a multiplayer scenario.

#### **Using [DLVK](https://www.github.com/VansKFC/DLVK) to use:**
- [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)) 
 **instead of** 
- [Direct3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct3D)
**allowing for much higher hardware effiiency and lower strain.**

## _Which may improve:_
 - Load times
 - Stability
 - Visuals
 - Hardware temperatures _and general health_
