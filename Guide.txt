The file type extensions have been changed for development convenience and for better management.

Releases will not require any conversion as they will be pre-converted.
There'll be two source downloads, one with converted types (.scr, .def) and the default/git version (.cpp, .h).

When building from Git version, you will need to convert them like so:

.cpp = .scr
.hpp = .def
.h = ini

Files in the /data/postprocess/ directory are .ppfx (mostly)
Files in the /data/presets/ directory are .pre
XML files stay the same.

I'm doing this for:

- easier forking
- github statistics
- easier updating

If you have any questions, contact me.
