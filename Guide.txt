The file type extensions have been changed for development convenience and for better management.

Releases will not require any conversion as they will be pre-converted.
There'll be two source downloads, one with converted types (.scr, .def) and the default/git version (.cpp, .h).

When building from Git version, you will need to convert them like so:

.cpp = .scr
.h = .def

Files in the /data/postprocess/ directory are .ppfx
Files in the /data/presets/ directory are .pre
If some files have an "ini" commented on them, build them as a .ini file regardless of file extension.
XML files stay the same.

I'm doing this for:

- easier forking
- github statistics
- easier updating

If you have any questions, contact me.
